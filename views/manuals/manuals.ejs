            <h2>Equipment Basics</h2>
            <p>Before you head out fishing, ensure you have the right equipment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rod and Reel</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spinning Rod and Reel: Ideal for beginners due to their versatility and ease of use.
                        </li>
                        <li>Baitcasting Rod and Reel: Offers better control and accuracy, suitable for experienced
                            anglers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Line</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monofilament Line: Stretchy and forgiving, great for beginners.</li>
                        <li>Braided Line: Strong with no stretch, offers better sensitivity for experienced anglers.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hooks, Sinkers, and Floats</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hooks: Various sizes and types; choose based on the fish species.</li>
                        <li>Sinkers: Add weight to the line, helping the bait sink to the desired depth.</li>
                        <li>Floats/Bobbers: Keep the bait suspended and indicate when a fish bites.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Choosing the Right Bait</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Live Bait</strong>: Worms, minnows, and insects. Effective but require proper storage
                    and
                    handling.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Lures</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soft Plastics: Mimic worms and other prey.</li>
                        <li>Crankbaits: Imitate small fish and attract larger predators.</li>
                        <li>Spinnerbaits: Create vibrations and flashes that attract fish.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Basic Techniques</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Casting</strong>: Practice accurate casting to place your bait where fish are likely to
                    be.
                    Use overhead or sidearm casts depending on the environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Retrieving</strong>: Vary the speed and pattern of your retrieve to mimic the natural
                    movement of prey. Pause intermittently to entice fish.</li>
                <li><strong>Setting the Hook</strong>: When you feel a bite, quickly and firmly lift the rod to set
                    the
                    hook in the fish's mouth.</li>
            </ul>
